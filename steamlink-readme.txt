- ABOUT -
SteamLink is an effort to run Half-Life: Uplink from Steam as easily as
possible, while leaving it as true to the original demo as possible.  No
in-game content has been modified, and the "loading" and menu
backgrounds are taken directly from the original Uplink, as opposed to
the generic Half-Life screens in Steam.

- INSTALLATION -
Extract the archive so the "steamlink" directory is under the
"half-life" directory in your Steam profile.  i.e.:

C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\joeuser\half-life\steamlink

Restart Steam, and "Half-Life: Uplink" should appear as a "Third party
mod".

- THANKS -
Valve Software, of course, for Half-Life, Half-Life: Uplink and Steam.

Jason Stephens' Uplink Lite, for inspiring me to create a proper "mod"
for Half-Life: Uplink.

Werner Spahl's Uplink Addon, for fixing the
scientist-speaking-with-two-tongues bug.
