- ABOUT -
SteamLink is an effort to run Half-Life: Uplink from Steam as easily as
possible, while leaving it as true to the original demo as possible.  No
in-game content has been modified, and the "loading" and menu
backgrounds are taken directly from the original Uplink, as opposed to
the generic Half-Life screens in Steam.

- INSTALLATION -
Extract the archive so the "steamlink" directory is under the
"half-life" directory in your Steam profile.  i.e.:

C:\Program Files\Steam\SteamApps\joeuser\half-life\steamlink

Restart Steam, and "Half-Life: Uplink" should appear as a "Third party
mod".

- NOTES -
It appears the "Servers" options cannot be removed from the main menu.
"Create Server" will crash the game.

Other than that, SteamLink should be as true to the original as
possible.  Enjoy!

- THANKS -
Valve Software, of course, for Half-Life, Half-Life: Uplink and Steam.

Jason Stephens' Uplink Lite, for inspiring me to create a proper "mod"
for Half-Life: Uplink.

scientist-speaking-with-two-tongues bug.
